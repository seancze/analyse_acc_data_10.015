# Guide to use the example data

## What is the example?
- The following .csv file is an example file exported from the "Acceleration" app. 

## How to make use of it?
1) Download the example file and better to save it in a folder to run the Jupyter Notebook file and store the results.
2) Rename the file to "Upper Changi > EXPO" and do not file format (keep it as .csv). (Renaming is not necessary for the file to run, but it does help you to organise the files)
3) Get the Jupyter Notebook file in the same folder of this example csv file.
4) Start running the Jupter Notebook file to make sense of how we plot the graphs according to the original data.
5) After getting the results, open the "example_output" folder for verification of your outputs.
