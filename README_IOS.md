# Physics 1D Project (Analyse Acceleration Data)
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Download <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python</a>
- Have the following Python libraries: csv, Pandas, Matplotlib

### Instructions -- Learn how we manipulate the data collected
1) Download the Jupyter Notebook file
2) Copy the Jupyter Notebook file into the folder where your the csv file exists. And rename your csv file as "Station A > Station B.csv"
3) Open the Jupyter Notebook, follow the instructions and run the cells.
4) When running the file, there will be times to ask you to input the file name. Just enter the renamed file name.
5) You can view the printed data results and view the graphs in Jupyter Notebook. At the same time, a "Graph" folder will be created in the same folder as your csv file containing the graphs (a-t, v-t, s-t).

### Instructions -- Quickly get the results & graphs
1) Download the Python file
2) Copy the Python file into the folder where your the csv file exists. And rename your csv file as "Station A > Station B.csv"
3) Open the Python file and start running the program
4) Already got the printed results and graphs created in your computer!
