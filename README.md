# Physics 1D Project (Analyse Acceleration Data)
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Download <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python</a>
- Have the following Python libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib (It may be automatically installed when you run the file but I'm not sure)

### Instructions
1) Download .py file into the folder of your choice
2) Enter into the folder/directory via the command prompt: cd <file_path>
3) Type 'python analyse_acc_data.py > (*choose_a_file_name*).txt'
4) Enter the path to your excel file in the command prompt. For example, /Users/Sean/Desktop/Train Data (Cashew > Botanic).xlsx
5) Wait for a few minutes. If no error occurs, you got it!

### What Should Happen
1) A file labelled '(*choose_a_file_name*).txt' will be created in your folder
2) A folder labelled 'Graphs' will be created with all images of the graphs stored in the folder as a .png file.
They will be labelled according to the name of your Excel sheets.
